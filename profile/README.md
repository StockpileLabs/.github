  <h2>✨ Who are we?</h2>
  <p>
    Stockpile Labs is an organization dedicated to working with growing technology products, initiatives, and communities to raise funds, reward their backers, distribute grants, manage their treasuries, and conduct    governance via high-performance blockchain infrastructure. We build and employ open-source Solana based primitives for systems like milestone-based crowdfunding, quadratic funding, token governance, and conviction voting. 

Our mission is to build engines for economic dynamism, powered by open, inclusive financial and compute infrastructure.
