  <h2>âœ¨ Who are we?</h2>
  <p>
    Stockpile is an organization dedicated to building general tools, funding primitives, 
    and being an overall support system for Solana ecosystem projects and initiatives. 
    Our mission is to empower people, projects, organizations and beyond with robust, 
    decentralized funding. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Our flagship product is the Stockpile platform, which is a crowdfunding platform for projects
    and causes making Web3 matter. In addition, we have the open-source Stockpile Protocol: a robust
    funding primitive which encapsulates general crowdfunding, quadratic funding, and milestone-based
    funding all in one package.
